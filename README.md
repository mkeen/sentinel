# Argo Sentinel

An all-powerful toolset for Argo.

Sentinel is an autonomous agent for persisting, processing and automating Argo 1.0 (Dash V12.1) governance objects and
tasks, and for expanded functions in the upcoming Argo 2.0 (Dash V13) release (Evolution).

Sentinel is implemented as a Python application that binds to a local version 1.0.0 argod instance on each Argo v1.0,0 Masternode.

This guide covers installing Sentinel onto an existing 1.0.0 Masternode in Ubuntu 14.04 / 16.04.

## Installation

### 1. Install Prerequisites

Make sure Python version 2.7.x or above is installed:

    python --version

Update system packages and ensure virtualenv is installed:

    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get -y install virtualenv

Make sure the local Argo daemon running is at least version 1.0.0 (100000)

    $ argo-cli getinfo | grep version

### 2. Install Sentinel

Clone the Sentinel repo and install Python dependencies.

    $ git clone https://github.com/argocoins/sentinel.git && cd sentinel
    $ virtualenv ./venv
    $ ./venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt

### 3. Test the Configuration

Test the config by runnings all tests from the sentinel folder you cloned into

    $ ./venv/bin/py.test ./test

With all tests passing and crontab setup, Sentinel will stay in sync with argod and the installation is complete
Run the sentinel once. It may pause for up to 30 seconds before returning. There should be no output in a normal return

    $ ./venv/bin/python bin/sentinel.py

Adjust access rights to the sentinel database

    $ chmod -R 755 database

### 4. Set up Cron

Set up a crontab entry to call Sentinel every minute:

    $ crontab -e

In the crontab editor, add the lines below, replacing '/home/YOURUSERNAME/sentinel' to the path where you cloned sentinel to:

    * * * * * cd /home/YOURUSERNAME/sentinel && ./venv/bin/python bin/sentinel.py >> sentinel.log 2>&1

## Configuration

An alternative (non-default) path to the `argo.conf` file can be specified in `sentinel.conf`:

    argo_conf=/path/to/argo.conf

## Troubleshooting

To view debug output, set the `SENTINEL_DEBUG` environment variable to anything non-zero, then run the script manually:

    $ SENTINEL_DEBUG=1 ./venv/bin/python bin/sentinel.py
